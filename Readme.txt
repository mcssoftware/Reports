I tried to create this Power BI report for managing Appointments for an Optical Manager, for test purpose.
This report allows me to see patients details. The next appointment due based on the following logic - 
Age under 25- require an eye exam once a year, 
Age 25 upto and including 55- once every 6 months, 
Age greater than 55- should be having an appointment once every 3 months. 
Also created an indicator or status to see which patients were due for appointments.
The Test dataset is included.
