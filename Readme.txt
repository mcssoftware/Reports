I tried to create this Power BI reports for learning and with dataset available on the internet.

For the Optical Dataset;
This report allows to see the Optometric patients appointment details.
The next appointment due date based on the following logic -> 
Age under 25- require an eye exam once a year, 
Age 25 upto and including 55- once every 6 months, 
Age greater than 55- should be having an appointment once every 3 months. 
Also created an indicator or status to see which patients were due for appointments,
the change in there eye measurements from last appointment.The Test dataset is included.


For Supplier Analysis;
The task was to find which vendors/plants are causing greatest defect quality and greatest downtime.
Here I learned to find top N best/worst category, using WhatIf parameters. Also explored the
new smart narrative feature. And implemented Bookmarks for layering visuals. Learnt the ease/difficulties
of using page navigation and bookmarks.


For Accounts AR Dataset; 
Cleaned the dataset that was really messy and prepared the aging report.
This was a Power Query excercise as the source data had to be cleaned.
